## Installation

To install the `@syncfusion/react-locale` package, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @syncfusion/react-locale
```

## Usage

### Loading Locale Data

Import the desired locale JSON file and use the `L10n.load` method to register the locale data.

```tsx
import { L10n } from '@syncfusion/react-base';
import german from '@syncfusion/react-locale/src/de.json';

L10n.load(german);
```

## Applying Locale with Provider

Wrap your application or component tree with the `Provider` component from `@syncfusion/react-base` and specify the desired locale.

```tsx
import { Provider } from '@syncfusion/react-base';
import {  NumericTextBox } from "@syncfusion/react-inputs";

<Provider locale="de">
  <NumericTextBox placeholder="Enter value" width={250} defaultValue={20} />
</Provider>
```
> This ensures that all child components respect the specified locale.

Refer to the [Localization Documentation](https://react.syncfusion.com/common-features/localization) for detailed usage instructions and examples.
